    <p>In 1979, Lois Rodden started publishing birth data with her book, Profiles of Women. Eventually this led onto the formation of Astrodatabank.[2][3][4] Mark McDonough[5] developed the Astrodatabank database work using the astrology birth data collected by Lois Rodden over 40 years of research.[6] Six months before Lois Rodden died, Lois named Pat Taglilatelo as her successor.[7] The data collection of another lifelong collector, Edwin Charles Steinbrecher, was integrated into the database during the next two years.

        In July 2005, McDonough gave Richard Smoot ownership of the company. Astrodatabank was later bought by the Swiss company Astrodienst AG, of Alois Treindl, in 2008,[8] and converted into a wiki project and made freely accessible to all.[9]
        
        Astrodatabank as a wiki was released on 12 March 2009, with 72,271 pages, in English. The names Astrodatabank, Astro-Databank, AstroDatabank, and ADB refer to the one and same project Astrodatabank.[</p>
