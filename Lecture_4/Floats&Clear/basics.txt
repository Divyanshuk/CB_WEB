difference between layout and normal flow

Layout :- Positioning of elements in page, and if viewport/page dimensions changes, 
          the layout adjusts itself is called responsive layout

          we use display, positions, flex-boxes, grids, float, clear etc attributes are used

Normal-Flow :- it means the way elements lay themselves out if we have not changed their layout and we can alter this
